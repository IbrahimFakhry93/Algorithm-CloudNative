//& Title: Pseudocode Writing Guide
//
//?Note: This guide outlines key steps to craft clear, effective pseudocode.
//         Use these steps as a quick reference when studying or drafting your algorithms.
//
//* Step 1: Understand the Problem
//   - Read the problem statement carefully.
//   - Identify the required inputs, processes, and expected outputs.
//
//* Step 2: Identify the Main Components
//   - Break down the overall task into key operations.
//   - Determine the necessary variables and how they change throughout the algorithm.
//
//* Step 3: Outline the Flow
//   - Sketch a rough blueprint with simple constructs:
//       • Use "BEGIN" and "END" to denote the start and finish of your pseudocode.
//       • Define sections for Input/Output, processing, and decision-making.
//
//* Step 4: Write in Plain Language
//   - Describe each step using everyday language, avoiding specific programming syntax.
//   - Focus on plainly conveying your logic and intentions.
//
//* Step 5: Use Clear Structure and Indentation
//   - Organize your pseudocode with proper indentation to clearly show hierarchy.
//   - Make nested structures (loops, conditionals) easily identifiable.
//
//* Step 6: Employ Common Control Structures
//   - Incorporate standard constructs such as:
//       • IF/ELSE: For decision-making.
//       • FOR or WHILE loops: For repetitive tasks.
//       • Functions/Procedures: For modular, reusable code segments.
//
//* Step 7: Review and Refine
//   - Re-read your pseudocode as if explaining it to someone else.
//   - Ensure each step is clear, logical, and unambiguous.
//
// Example: Summing Numbers in a List
//
// BEGIN
//     sum <- 0                  // Initialize the accumulator
//     FOR each number in the list
//         sum <- sum + number   // Update the sum by adding the current number
//     END FOR
//     RETURN sum                // Output the final result
// END
//
//? Additional Tips:
//* Be Consistent: Use uniform keywords and formatting throughout your pseudocode.
//* Prioritize Human Understanding: Clarity is more important than strict syntax adherence.
//* Practice Regularly: Frequent practice will help you refine your style and approach.
