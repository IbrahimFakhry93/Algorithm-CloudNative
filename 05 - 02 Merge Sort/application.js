//& Title: Applications of Merge Sort in Data Engineering

//? Note:
//   Merge sort, with its O(n log n) time complexity and stable sorting mechanism, is highly valued in data engineering.
//   It efficiently handles large datasets that exceed memory capacity and is ideal for merging pre-sorted data streams.
//
//* Subnote: External Sorting
//   - When datasets are too large to fit in memory, they're split into chunks that are individually sorted in-memory.
//   - These sorted chunks (or "runs") are then merged using an external merge sort process, optimizing disk usage.
//
//* Subnote: Merging Sorted Streams
//   - Data streams arriving in sorted order (e.g., log files sorted by timestamps) can be merged efficiently.
//   - Merge sort quickly combines these streams into a single, globally sorted list while minimizing re-sorting.
//
//* Subnote: Integration in Distributed Processing Frameworks
//   - In systems like Hadoop and Spark, data is partitioned across nodes and sorted locally.
//   - A final merge phase combines these sorted partitions, ensuring scalable and efficient processing.
//
//* Subnote: Stability in Sorting Key-Value Data
//   - By maintaining the relative order of items with equal keys, merge sort is crucial in ETL processes.
//   - This stability preserves data integrity in data warehousing scenarios.
//
//* Further Considerations:
//   - Resource Efficiency: Predictable memory and compute requirements help in planning resource allocation.
//   - Parallel Merging: Merge steps lend themselves well to parallel execution on multi-core or distributed architectures.
//   - Real-time Data Processing: Continuous merging techniques derived from merge sort support real-time, streaming data applications.
