//! 20 – Greedy Algorithm – Huffman Coding – Algorithm

//* applied in data compression

//* english char is 8 bit
//* arabic char is 16 bit

//* character representation in computer
//* every character represented eventually in PC as binary

//* char => decimal code  => Binary

//* required:
//* compress number of bis used to encode the characters
