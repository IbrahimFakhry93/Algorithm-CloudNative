//& Title: Real-World Application of Insertion Sort in Data Engineering
//
//?Note: This snippet outlines practical scenarios where insertion sort proves useful,
//         especially when dealing with nearly sorted data in streaming environments
//         or as a component of hybrid sorting algorithms like Timsort.
//
//*^ Scenario 1: Real-Time Sensor Data Processing
//* - Streaming sensor data often arrives in nearly chronological order.
//* - Occasional data points arrive out-of-order due to network delays.
//* - Insertion sort can quickly insert an out-of-order data point into its correct position,
//*   leveraging its near-linear efficiency when the data is almost sorted.
//*
//* Pseudocode for Updating Sorted Sensor Data:
//   function updateSensorData(sortedData, newDataPoint):
//       Start at the end of the sorted array
//       index = length(sortedData) - 1
//       Shift elements to the right until finding the correct place for newDataPoint
//       while index >= 0 and sortedData[index] > newDataPoint:
//           sortedData[index + 1] = sortedData[index]
//           index = index - 1
//       end while
//       Insert the new data point
//       sortedData[index + 1] = newDataPoint
//       return sortedData
//
//^ Scenario 2: Hybrid Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Timsort)
//* - Timsort, used in many programming languages like Python, leverages insertion sort
//*   to efficiently sort small or nearly sorted subarrays.
//* - This approach reduces overhead and increases performance in large-scale data processing pipelines.
//*
//* Key Takeaways:
//* - In nearly sorted datasets, insertion sortâ€™s efficiency in handling small reorders is crucial.
//* - Its integration in hybrid algorithms demonstrates its value beyond academic examples,
//*   contributing to real-world performance optimization in data engineering.
