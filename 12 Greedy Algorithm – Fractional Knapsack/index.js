//! 22 – Greedy Algorithm – Fractional Knapsack Problem – Algorithm – Code

//& Requirements
//* We want to put items in the knapsack to gain highest profit

//? traditional method
//^ apply brute force method
//* The "brute force method" in mathematics, also known as "proof by exhaustion,"
//* involves systematically checking (all) possible cases to prove a statement.
//* It's a direct proof method where you break down the problem
//* into a finite number of scenarios and verify the statement holds true for each.

//? Greedy Method:
//* one operation and get the highest profit

//^ problem:
//* Knapsack max capacity is 12 kg

//^ criteria to apply greedy method:
//* that the item could be divided, so it's called fractional Knapsack problem

//^ pseudo code:
//^ look up the slide
//^ open: pseudoCode.js
