//& Title: Applications of Greedy Algorithms in Data Engineering

//? Note: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step.
//* These are widely used in data engineering where fast approximations are crucial.

//^ Data Compression (Huffman Coding)
//* Efficiently encoding large datasets to reduce storage size.
//* Huffman coding assigns shorter bit representations to frequent elements.

//^ Load Balancing in Distributed Systems
//* Assigning tasks to servers efficiently to maximize performance.
//* The algorithm selects the least-loaded server for each incoming task.

//^ Network Routing (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
//* Finding the shortest path in networked systems, optimizing data transfer routes.
//* The algorithm greedily selects the closest available node to determine the shortest path.

//^ Database Indexing & Query Optimization
//* Speeding up search queries in large datasets.
//* Greedy selection of frequently accessed columns for indexing minimizes query processing time.

//^ Memory Management and Cache Optimization
//* Managing limited memory resources efficiently.
//* Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement uses greedy choices to improve access speed.

//^ Feature Selection in Machine Learning
//* Selecting the most relevant features for training models without exhaustive searching.
//* Greedy algorithms iteratively remove the least relevant features to refine model efficiency.

//^ Graph Partitioning in Big Data Processing
//* Dividing large datasets for parallel computing.
//* Heuristic greedy methods assign data chunks to minimize computation overlap in distributed environments.

//? Note: Greedy algorithms excel in real-time decision-making and low computational cost scenarios.
//* They strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy.
