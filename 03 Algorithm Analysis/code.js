//! 05 – Algorithms Analysis – Introduction

//* algorithm analysis measures approximately code efficiency or performance, according to infinite number number of inputs

//* code efficiency means time that the code will take to be executed

//! 06 – Algorithms Analysis – Calculus Function

//* function in math: is a mathematical relation between two variables (x , y)
//* whenever x value changes, y will be changed.

//* المجال للدالة هو القيم المحتملة للبيانات الداخلة

//* function domain: it's the possible values for inputs
//* function range: it's the possible values for outputs

//! 07 – Algorithms Analysis – Big O Notation

//* notation: forms or symbols to describe group of values or operations

//* Growth rate of a function, with respect to inputs growth and resulted outputs growth in contrast
//* O === Order of the function

//* كلما ما بكبر المدخلات، المخرجات بتزيد بشكل قد ايه

//* base of log in computer science is 2
//* base of log in math is 10

//* log(n) < n

//* log (16) = 4
//* 2 ** 4 = 16

//! 08 – Algorithms Analysis – Drawing Complexity classes on graph

//* o(n) === number of inputs equals number of iterations that code will execute

//* the more the graph inclines towards x axis, the better the order of code is
//*  the more the graph inclines towards y axis, the worse the order of code is
