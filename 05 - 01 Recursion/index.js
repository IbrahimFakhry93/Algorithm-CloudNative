//! 10 â€“ Recursion

//& Code Segment
//* program memory structure (code segment) splits into:
//* code section: binary form of compiled code
//* stack: store primitive data types and pointer of reference data types
//* functions store its variables including parameters in the stack frame in the stack

//* heap: store reference data types

//*================================

//& Recursion:

//* function calls itself recursively.
//* It relies on a base case to stop the recursive calls and prevents infinite recursion.
//* when the function calls itself, it calls itself with parameters approach to base condition
//! to avoid code exception (error) which is called stack overflow
