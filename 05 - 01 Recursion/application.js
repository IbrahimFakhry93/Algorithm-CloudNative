//& Title: Applications and Explanation of Recursion in Data Engineering
//
//?Note: This snippet provides an overview of recursion with a practical example in sorting,
//         and highlights other real-world applications of recursion in data engineering.
//
//^ Recursion Overview:
//* - Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself, working on a smaller part of the problem.
//* - It relies on a base case to stop the recursive calls and prevents infinite recursion.
//* - Recursive solutions can simplify code for problems that naturally break down into similar subproblems.
//
//* Recursive Insertion Sort Pseudocode:
//   function recursiveInsertionSort(arr, n):
//       if n <= 1 then
//           return arr                   // Base case: an array with one element is already sorted.
//       recursiveInsertionSort(arr, n - 1) // Recursively sort the first n-1 elements.
//       key = arr[n - 1]                   // Consider the nth element as the key for insertion.
//       j = n - 2
//       while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key do    // Shift elements in the sorted part that are greater than key.
//           arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
//           j = j - 1
//       end while
//       arr[j + 1] = key                   // Insert key in its correct position.
//       return arr
//
//^ Real-World Applications of Recursion in Data Engineering:
//* - **Directory Traversal:** Recursion is often used to traverse file systems when ingesting data,
//*   allowing a program to handle directories within directories.
//* - **Tree/Graph Traversal:** Hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts or database
//*   indexes, benefit from recursive algorithms to explore nodes and relationships.
//* - **Nested Data Parsing:** Formats such as JSON or XML have nested structures; recursion helps in
//*   parsing and processing such data cleanly.
//* Key Considerations:
//* - Always define a clear base case to avoid infinite recursion.
//* - Monitor the recursion depth to prevent potential stack overflow issues, considering iterative alternatives when needed.
